The rules are simple: **one commit a day for 21 days.**

No need to build the next big thing. No need to master everything at once. Just write some code, push it, and come back tomorrow.

[@ercandotsui](https://x.com/ercandotsui) made this challenge because learning Move shouldn't feel like a mountain. It should feel like a habit — something small you do daily until it just clicks.

## Why This Matters

I've seen smart developers give up on blockchain. Not because they couldn't do it. They totally could. But because every tutorial out there assumes you already know Rust, already get how consensus works, already have opinions on VM stuff.

**That's a lot to ask from someone just starting out.**

Move is different. Sui's version of Move is even more different. But going from "never touched Move" to "can actually build something" has always been hard. There wasn't a clear path.

This challenge changes that.

The 21-Day Challenge breaks things into small pieces. Day 1? You define three constants. That's it. You type them, build, commit. Done.

No single day is magic. But doing it every day? **That's where it adds up.**

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before writing any Move code, you need two things: the Sui CLI and a good way to interact with it.

### Installing Sui CLI

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mystenlabs/suiup/main/install.sh | sh
suiup install sui@testnet
sui --version
```

If you see a version number, you're ready.

### The Better Way: Sui CLI Web

Here's the thing — the terminal is powerful but not always pleasant. I built [Sui CLI Web](https://cli.firstmovers.io) because I got tired of copying addresses, hunting for object IDs, and staring at walls of JSON.

  <figcaption className="text-center text-white/50 text-sm mt-3">
    Sui CLI Web: A visual interface that talks to your local Sui CLI
  </figcaption>
</figure>

It's a browser-based interface that connects to your local Sui CLI. Click what you need, see the results instantly.

- **Check balance** — see all your coins at a glance
- **Get testnet tokens** — one-click faucet
- **View transactions** — explore your tx history
- **Switch networks** — toggle between testnet/mainnet/devnet

Your private keys never leave your machine. The web interface just makes the CLI actually pleasant to use.

### VS Code Setup

Get [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the **Move** extension by Mysten Labs. This gives you:
- Syntax highlighting
- Error detection as you type
- Go-to-definition for Move code

Trust me, you want this.

### Clone the Challenge

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riva-labs/21Challenge.git
cd 21Challenge
```

Verify everything works:

```bash
cd day_01
sui move build
```

See "Build successful"? Let's dive into Day 1.

---

## Day 1 Deep Dive

Day 1 looks simple on paper: "Define some constants." But there's a lot hiding under the surface. Let me show you what I actually wrote for my Day 1.

### The Module Structure

Every Move file starts with a module declaration:

```move
module challenge::day_01 {
    // Everything goes here
}
```

The format is `package_name::module_name`. Think of it like namespacing in other languages. The `challenge` part comes from your `Move.toml` file.

### Basic Constants

The simplest thing you can do in Move:

```move
const NUMBER: u64 = 42;
const FLAG: bool = true;
const MY_ADDRESS: address = @0x1;
```

Three types, three constants. But here's what's interesting about each:

**`u64`** — This is an unsigned 64-bit integer. Move doesn't have signed integers. No negative numbers. This might feel limiting, but it eliminates an entire class of bugs (underflow to negative values).

**`bool`** — Just `true` or `false`. Nothing fancy.

**`address`** — This is unique to Move. Every object, every account, every package has an address. The `@` prefix is Move syntax for "this is an address literal."

### The Integer Type Spectrum

Move has six integer sizes:

```move
const TINY: u8 = 255;                    // 0 to 255
const SMALL: u16 = 65_535;               // 0 to 65,535
const MEDIUM: u32 = 4_294_967_295;       // 0 to ~4.3 billion
const LARGE: u64 = 18_446_744_073_709_551_615;  // The big one
const HUGE: u128 = 340_282_366_920_938_463_463_374_607_431_768_211_455;
const MASSIVE: u256 = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF;
```

Why so many? **Gas optimization.** If you're storing a number that's always between 0-255, using `u8` costs less than `u64`. On-chain, every byte matters.

The underscores (`1_000_000`) are just for readability. The compiler ignores them.

### Number Formats

Move supports different ways to write numbers:

```move
const DECIMAL: u64 = 1_000_000;     // One million
const HEX: u64 = 0xDEADBEEF;        // Hex format
const HEX_BYTE: u8 = 0xFF;          // 255 in hex
const WITH_SUFFIX: u8 = 100u8;      // Explicit type suffix
```

The hex format (`0x...`) is common when dealing with addresses or bit manipulation. The type suffix (`100u8`) lets you be explicit about the type without a separate declaration.

### Addresses in Sui

```move
const ZERO_ADDR: address = @0x0;
const SUI_FRAMEWORK: address = @0x2;
const STD_ADDR: address = @0x1;
const CHALLENGE_ADDR: address = @challenge;
```

Some addresses are special:
- `@0x1` — The Move standard library
- `@0x2` — The Sui framework (where `Coin`, `TxContext`, etc. live)
- `@challenge` — A named address from your `Move.toml`

Named addresses are powerful. Instead of hardcoding hex strings, you reference them by name and set the actual value in config.

---

## Move Type System

Here's where Move gets interesting. Let me show you things that would break in most languages but work perfectly here.

### Type Casting (The Safe Way)

```move
fun widen_types(): u256 {
    let a: u8 = 100;
    let b: u16 = (a as u16);    // u8 → u16: safe
    let c: u32 = (b as u32);    // u16 → u32: safe
    let d: u64 = (c as u64);    // u32 → u64: safe
    let e: u128 = (d as u128);  // u64 → u128: safe
    (e as u256)                  // u128 → u256: safe
}
```

**Widening** (small → large) is always safe. You can't lose data going from `u8` to `u64`.

But **narrowing** is dangerous:

```move
fun narrow_types_safe(): u8 {
    let val: u64 = 200;   // fits in u8
    (val as u8)            // works!
}

// But this ABORTS at runtime:
fun this_will_crash(): u8 {
    let val: u64 = 256;   // too big for u8!
    (val as u8)            // ABORT
}
```

Move doesn't silently truncate. If you try to squeeze 256 into a `u8`, the transaction aborts. **This is a feature.** Silent data loss is how billion-dollar bugs happen in other languages.

### Safety Tests

Here's what I love about Move. You can write tests that *expect* failures:

```move
#[test]
#[expected_failure(arithmetic_error, location = Self)]
fun test_overflow_aborts() {
    let max: u64 = 18_446_744_073_709_551_615;
    let _x = max + 1;  // ABORT: overflow
}

#[test]
#[expected_failure(arithmetic_error, location = Self)]
fun test_underflow_aborts() {
    let zero: u64 = 0;
    let _x = zero - 1;  // ABORT: underflow
}

#[test]
#[expected_failure(arithmetic_error, location = Self)]
fun test_division_by_zero_aborts() {
    let x: u64 = 100;
    let _y = x / 0;  // ABORT: div by zero
}
```

No undefined behavior. No weird wrapping. If math goes wrong, **the transaction stops.** You can't accidentally drain a pool because of an underflow.

### Bitwise Operations

For the systems programmers:

```move
fun bitwise_operations(): u64 {
    let a: u64 = 12; // Binary: 1100
    let b: u64 = 10; // Binary: 1010

    let _and = a & b;     // 1000 = 8
    let _or = a | b;      // 1110 = 14
    let xor = a ^ b;      // 0110 = 6
    let lshift = a << 2;  // 110000 = 48
    let rshift = a >> 1;  // 110 = 6

    xor + lshift + rshift // 60
}
```

You'll use these for flags, permissions, and compact data storage. Not Day 1 stuff usually, but good to know they exist.

---

## Running Your First Tests

Here's the payoff. Run this in your Day 1 folder:

```bash
sui move test
```

You should see something like:

```
Running Move unit tests
[ PASS    ] challenge::day_01::test_basic_constants
[ PASS    ] challenge::day_01::test_type_widening
[ PASS    ] challenge::day_01::test_narrowing_aborts_on_overflow
[ PASS    ] challenge::day_01::test_bitwise
[ PASS    ] challenge::day_01::test_arithmetic
...
Test result: OK. 12 passed; 0 failed
```

**All green.** That's Day 1 done.

<WorkflowCycle client:visible />

That's Day 1 wrapped. You've learned Move's type system, written safety tests, and built your first module. Tomorrow we'll add functions and start making things actually *do* something.

**The foundation is set. Now we build.**

---

## The Week Ahead

<RevealOnScroll client:visible>

### Week 1: Foundations (Days 1-7)

- **Day 1**: Modules and primitive types (you just did this!)
- **Day 2**: Functions and visibility
- **Day 3**: Structs and data modeling
- **Day 4**: Abilities (`copy`, `drop`, `store`, `key`)
- **Day 5**: References and borrowing
- **Day 6**: Generics basics
- **Day 7**: Your first Sui object

By Day 7, you'll build a simple counter — an object you can create, increment, and read. Not going to win hackathons, but it teaches you how Sui objects *actually* work.

### Week 2: Objects (Days 8-14)

This is where Sui starts feeling different. You'll learn about ownership, shared objects, entry functions, and events. By Day 14, you'll mint an NFT.

### Week 3: Patterns (Days 15-21)

The advanced stuff: generics, the "hot potato" pattern, capability-based security, and creating your own tokens. By Day 21, you'll deploy a complete dApp.

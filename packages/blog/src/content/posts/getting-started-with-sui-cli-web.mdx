Welcome to Sui CLI Web! This tutorial will get you from zero to hero in just 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed ([download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Sui CLI** installed ([installation guide](https://docs.sui.io/build/install))
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

Don't have Sui CLI yet? Run this:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://get.sui.io | sh

# or with npm
npm install -g @mysten/sui
```

## Installation

Installing Sui CLI Web Server takes one command:

```bash
npm install -g sui-cli-web-server
```

Now start the server:

```bash
sui-cli-web-server
```

You should see:

```
🚀 Sui CLI Web Server v1.5.0
📡 Server running at http://localhost:3001
🔐 Security: localhost only (your keys are safe)
✅ Ready to connect!
```

## First Steps

### Opening the App

Navigate to [cli.firstmovers.io](https://cli.firstmovers.io) in your browser. The app will automatically detect your local server.

> **Tip**: If you see "Connecting...", make sure your server is running!

### Creating Your First Wallet

1. Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K` on Windows) to open the command palette
2. Type "create wallet" and press Enter
3. Choose a name for your wallet (e.g., "dev-wallet")
4. Done! Your new wallet is ready to use

### Getting Testnet Tokens

1. Make sure you're on testnet (check the network indicator in the top right)
2. Open command palette (`Cmd+K`)
3. Type "faucet" and press Enter
4. Wait a few seconds for tokens to arrive

Your balance will update automatically!

## Sending Tokens

Let's send some SUI:

### Method 1: Command Palette

```
1. Press Cmd+K
2. Type "send" or "transfer"
3. Enter recipient address
4. Enter amount
5. Confirm and sign
```

### Method 2: Direct Navigation

```
1. Press Cmd+T to open Transfer panel
2. Select token (SUI)
3. Paste recipient address
4. Enter amount
5. Click "Send" or press Enter
```

### Understanding Gas Fees

Sui uses a unique gas model:
- Gas is paid in SUI tokens
- Transactions typically cost 0.001-0.01 SUI
- Failed transactions still consume gas

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Master these shortcuts to navigate like a pro:

| Shortcut | Action |

| `Cmd+T` | Quick Transfer |
| `Cmd+N` | Switch Network |
| `Esc` | Close modal/panel |
| `↑/↓` | Navigate lists |
| `Enter` | Select/Confirm |

### Pro Tips

1. **Quick Address Copy**: Click any address to copy it
2. **Search Everything**: The command palette searches across all features
3. **Network Switching**: `Cmd+N` lets you quickly switch between mainnet, testnet, and devnet

## Next Steps

Now that you're set up, explore these features:

- **Object Explorer** — Browse your NFTs and owned objects

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"

2. Check if port 3001 is available
3. Try restarting the server

### "Transaction failed"

1. Check your SUI balance (need gas!)
2. Verify the recipient address is valid
3. Make sure you're on the right network

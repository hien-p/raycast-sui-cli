## The Problem

Every Sui developer knows this workflow: copy an address from the terminal, paste it into another command, make a typo, start over. Switch networks, forget which one you're on, send to the wrong place. Deploy a contract, stare at a wall of JSON, hunt for your package ID.

The Sui CLI is powerful. But <span className="text-primary font-semibold">powerful doesn't mean pleasant</span>.

I was spending more time managing the tooling than actually building.

## The First Attempt: Raycast Extension

My first solution was a [Raycast](https://raycast.com) extension. If you're on macOS, Raycast is like Spotlight on steroids: a command palette for everything.

I wrapped common Sui CLI commands into Raycast actions: check balances, transfer tokens, switch networks, inspect objects. All accessible with `⌘K`.

  src="/blog/images/posts/introducing-sui-cli-web/raycast_cli.png"
  alt="Sui CLI Raycast Extension"
  caption="The Raycast extension. Fast, but macOS only."
/>

It worked great. For me. On my Mac.

But when I wanted to share it with my team:

> "Cool! How do I use it?"
>
> "Install Raycast, then add my extension..."
>
> "I'm on Windows."

<span className="text-[#ef4444]">A tool locked to one platform isn't really shareable.</span>
</RevealOnScroll>

## Second Attempt: Desktop App

Next, I tried building a cross-platform desktop app with Tauri. Same functionality, but packaged as a native application that runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

  alt="Sui CLI Desktop App built with Tauri"
  caption="The Tauri desktop app. Cross-platform, but still requires installation."
/>

It worked. But sharing still meant: "Download this installer, run it, trust this unsigned app, allow network access..."

<span className="text-[#ef4444]">Too much friction.</span>
</RevealOnScroll>

<RevealOnScroll client:visible>
## The Final Answer: Web

What if there was nothing to install at all?

A web app that talks to a local server. The UI runs in your browser. The server runs on your machine and executes CLI commands. Share a URL, and anyone can use it immediately.

The architecture was simple: **a web UI that talks to a local bridge server**. The bridge server runs on your machine and executes Sui CLI commands. Your keys never leave your computer.

```
Browser (any platform)  →  localhost:3001  →  Your Sui CLI
        ↑                        ↑                  ↑
    hosted UI              runs locally        your keys stay here
```

Setup takes one command:

<ImagePreview
  client:visible
  src="/blog/images/posts/introducing-sui-cli-web/setup.png"
  alt="Sui CLI Web Server setup - one command installation"
  caption="One command. That's it. Your existing Sui CLI config is automatically detected."
/>

Three weeks of building later, I had something unexpected:

<span className="text-[#22c55e] font-semibold text-lg">The web version was faster than the terminal.</span>

<ImagePreview
  client:visible
  src="/blog/images/posts/introducing-sui-cli-web/first_version.png"
  alt="First version of Sui CLI Web"
  caption="The first working version. Keyboard-driven with visual feedback."
/>

Not because it did less. It did the same things. But keyboard shortcuts eliminated repetitive typing. `⌘K` to open any command. `Tab` to autocomplete. Visual feedback caught errors before I submitted transactions.

The same workflow patterns from Raycast, now accessible to everyone.

## But Is It Safe?

Here's the problem with most web-based crypto tools: <span className="text-[#ef4444]">they want your private keys.</span>

Every browser wallet, every web app that can sign transactions: they all need access to your keys. That's a massive attack surface. One compromised website, one malicious extension, and your funds are gone.

I refused to build another key-custody tool. But how do you build a web app that can sign transactions without holding keys?

The answer came from an unexpected place: **the architecture of development tools like VS Code's Live Share.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    YOUR BROWSER                         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The web UI is just a pretty face. All the real work happens on your machine through a tiny bridge server. <span className="text-[#22c55e] font-semibold">Your private keys never touch the internet.</span> They never leave your computer. The hosted web app literally cannot access them.

## Real Workflows, Real Examples

Enough theory. Let me show you what using Sui CLI Web actually looks like.

### Example 1: Checking Balances Across Networks

**The old way (terminal):**
```bash
sui client switch --env testnet
sui client gas
# Copy output, parse mentally
sui client switch --env mainnet
sui client gas
# Try to remember testnet numbers
```

**The Sui CLI Web way:**
Press `Cmd+K`, type "balance". See all your addresses, all networks, all tokens in one view. Click to switch. No commands to remember.

<ImagePreview

  src="/blog/images/posts/introducing-sui-cli-web/check_balance.png"
  alt="Checking balances in Sui CLI Web"
  caption="All wallets, all networks, one view."
/>

### Example 2: Transferring SUI Tokens

**The old way:**
```bash
# First, find recipient address (where did I put it?)
# Check balance to pick a coin
sui client gas
# Copy coin object ID
sui client transfer-sui --to 0x1234...abcd --sui-coin-object-id 0xabc...123 --gas-budget 10000000
# Hope you didn't typo anything
```

**The Sui CLI Web way:**
`Cmd+K` → "transfer" → Select recipient from address book → Pick coin visually → Confirm. Done in 5 seconds with zero chance of address typos.

  alt="Transferring SUI tokens in Sui CLI Web"
  caption="Visual token selection. No more copying object IDs."
/>

### Example 3: Deploying a Move Contract

**The old way:**
```bash
cd my-project
sui move build
# Scroll through warnings
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
# Wait... did it work? Parse the JSON output
# Try to find the package ID in the wall of text
```

**The Sui CLI Web way:**
Open Move tab → Select project folder → Click Build → Review results visually → Click Deploy → See your package ID highlighted, ready to copy.

  <p className="text-white/90 text-lg font-medium mb-2">The Difference</p>
  <p className="text-white/60">It's not about doing things the CLI can't do. It's about doing the same things faster, with fewer mistakes, and without breaking your flow.</p>
</div>

## What's Next

The core covers about <span className="text-primary font-semibold">95% of Sui CLI commands</span>: address management, token transfers, gas splitting/merging, Move development, PTB builder, transaction inspection, key management, dynamic fields, security verification. Most daily workflows are already here.

But there's still room to improve.

    <p className="text-white/60 text-sm">Browse recent activity, filter by type, search by hash. The data exists on-chain. It just needs a proper interface.</p>

    <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">NFT gallery</h4>
    <p className="text-white/60 text-sm">See your NFTs as images instead of object IDs. Grid view, collection grouping, quick transfer actions.</p>

    <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Better onboarding</h4>
    <p className="text-white/60 text-sm">Installation guides for Windows, Linux, macOS. Video walkthroughs for common tasks.</p>
  </div>
</div>

The development philosophy stays simple: ship features that solve real problems. No bloat. Every addition has to earn its place.
